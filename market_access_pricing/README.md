# Description

- This project focused on bringing visibility over the current year, last year, and next year's prices, both with the current sales forecast and the fixed quarterly reference for comparison. 

- The report should be simple, and highly flexible for end user's customization, with filters, page navigation, F.A.Q. section, and exportable to Excel.

- The data should also follow strict rules on privacy, having established Row-Level Security using the user name. 

- Data on SAP IBP was queried through oData, plus some Excel files stored in SharePoint online.

- The report was published to a shared workspace and user adoption was tracked through the Usage Analytics functionality
