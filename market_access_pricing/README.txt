# This project focused on bringing visibility over the current year, last year, and next year's prices, both with the current sales forecast and the fixed quarterly reference for comparison. 
# The report should be simple, and highly flexible for end user's customization, with filters, page navigation, F.A.Q. section, and exportable to Excel.
# Data sources were queried through oData, plus some Excel files stored in SharePoint online.
